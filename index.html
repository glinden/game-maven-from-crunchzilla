	  <h3>How to Play</h3> 
	  Game Maven from Crunchzilla is the third and most advanced
	  programming tutorial in the Crunchzilla series. It teaches teens
	  and curious adults a little about programming by helping them
	  code a few casual games in Javascript.
	  <br><br>
	  It's easy to play. Follow the instructions and do what
	  Game Maven says.  Feel free to occasionally skip to the next lesson
	  if there is something you don't want to do.
	  You can always come back to it later!
	  <br><br>Click on the Reset button if you really mess up your
	  code and want to start over on a lesson. Click on the Back button 
	  to go back to a previous lesson. You can jump to a specific lesson
	  or back to the beginning using the "Lesson Sections" link.
	  <br><br>
	  Game Maven saves what lesson you are on, so feel free to stop
	  at any time and come back later.  As long as you come back on the
	  same browser on the same machine, you'll get back to your lesson.
	  <br><br> 
	  If you haven't done <a href="http://crunchzilla.com/code-maven">Code Maven</a> 
	  from Crunchzilla yet, you probably should do that
	  first unless you already have a lot of programming experience. 
	  Game Maven assumes you mostly know what Code Maven covered and 
	  might be really hard if you don't.
	  Besides, Code Maven from Crunchzilla is fun
	  too, you wouldn't want to miss it!
	  <br><br>
	  Have fun!

	  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	  <b>What is the c in things like <code>c.save()</code>?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  <code>c</code> is a variable Game Maven creates for you that contains the Canvas' 2D context.
	  The code that creates the variable <code>c</code>, which is hidden, looks like
	  <br><br>
	  <code>var c = document.getElementById('pane').getContext('2d');</code>
	  <br><br>
	  <b>How can I save my code and use it outside of Game Maven?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  Short answer: You can copy-and-paste your code and then load that code in
	  an HTML file (either loading a separate Javascript file or inlining the
	  Javascript in your HTML file).
	  <br><br>
	  Longer answer: A minimal HTML file that works would look like this:
	  <br><br>
	  <code>
		&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
		<br>
		&lt;canvas id=pane width=400 height=400&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
		<br>
		&lt;script&gt;
		<br>
		var c = document.getElementById(&#39;pane&#39;).getContext(&#39;2d&#39;);
		<br>
		<br>
		// PASTE YOUR CODE HERE
		<br>
		<br>
		&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>
	  <br><br>
	  If you copy that into a file, then copy-and-paste your game code into it, then
	  save the file with a filename ending in .html, you should be able to load the
	  file in any web browser and play your game.
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Is there any other code that is hidden from me?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  There is also a bit of hidden code to try to stop animations when you
	  change lessons and the code you write is instrumented to try to
	  prevent infinite loops. You shouldn't need those to run your game
	  outside of Game Maven.
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Why aren't you telling me more about the syntax and terminology of Javascript?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  There are already a lot of tutorials and textbooks out there that teach Javascript
	  programming by explaining what a variable is, what variable scope is, what the syntax
	  of an if statement looks like, how each of the operators work, and so on. If you want
	  that, there are many choices available, many of which are excellent supplements to
	  Game Maven.
	  <br><br>
	  What is hard to find is a tutorial that is fun, immersive, and gets you immediately 
	  building cool things. Game Maven skips a lot of the syntax and explanation you 
	  can get elsewhere (Google for it when you need it) and instead jumps straight into
	  the fun of what you can do if you learn to code.
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Why doesn't this work perfectly on an iPad (or other mobile device)?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  Game Maven will load on many mobile devices, might even be a bit playable
	  depending on your device, but it isn't designed for mobile. Why not?
	  <br><br>
	  Mostly because it is hard to type on mobile. Writing large amounts on a mobile
	  device is difficult, and it is even worse when what you are trying to write is code
	  and you need to keep looking at other parts of the code. Trying to write
	  large amounts of traditional code on a mobile device is not a good experience.
	  <br><br>
	  Because of that, no one seems to have created a great app yet for learning to code on
	  mobile, but there are good apps out there that teach programming 
	  concepts (such as Hopscotch, Move the Turtle, and Cargo-bot).
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Can I use Game Maven offline (when not connected to the internet)?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  Sure!  Game Maven only uses the internet at the very
	  beginning, to load the website, and then never contacts the
	  internet again.
	  <br><br>
	  So, for example, you can load Game Maven on a
	  laptop, then go on an airplane or walk to a park where there is
	  no internet connection, open your laptop there, and use Game
	  Maven without the internet.  It even still saves your place so
	  you get back to the same lesson when you return!  You donâ€™t need
	  an internet connection except at the very beginning
	  when the website loads.

	  <h3>About</h3>
	  Game Maven from Crunchzilla is live Javascript programming for
	  fun.  It's an interactive tutorial with a focus on action over explanation.
	  When you work through Game Maven, you dive right into coding, and the
	  code you write immediately yields visible results.
	  <br><br>
	  Game Maven from Crunchzilla  is the most advanced programming
	  tutorial in Crunchzilla series. Game Maven teaches some of the
	  basics of programming casual video games and is intended for
	  teens or adults who either have already done most of Code Maven or 
	  already have some programming experience.  <a href="http://crunchzilla.com/code-maven">Code Maven</a> assumes
	  no prior programming experience and teaches
	  teens and curious adults a bit about coding in a fun way,
	  including lots of experimenting 
	  with graphics and animation.  <a href="http://crunchzilla.com/code-monster">Code Monster</a>, the lightest and easiest 
	  tutorial, is like Code Maven but intended for pre-teen children (ages 9-14).
	  <br><br> 
	  Game Maven is intended to be a fun and exciting introduction to
	  programming concepts and building computer games.  It is a first 
	  step in learning to program. It is
	  not intended to teach a lot of computer science and programming, but
	  might convince people who might never have thought they could
	  program that coding is fun and something they might be able to do.
	  <br><br>
	  Game Maven from Crunchzilla is based in Seattle, WA.  It is part of the
	  Crunchzilla suite of game and educational projects being developed by
	  Geeky Ventures.

	  <h3>Privacy Policy</h3> 

	  Game Maven is extremely protective of privacy.  Game Maven
	  keeps almost no information about people who use the website.
	  <br><br>
	  Game Maven does not require registration.  It does not have
	  your e-mail address.  It does not know who you are.  When you
	  use Game Maven, you are essentially anonymous.
	  <br><br>
	  Game Maven does not use cookies.  If you leave the website and
	  come back, there is a feature that will get you back to the
	  lesson you were on.  That does not use cookies.  It is done
	  using HTML5 Local Storage, which stores data on your machine,
	  not remotely on the webservers.  Game Maven does not even know
	  what lesson you were on or how many lessons people using
	  Game Maven have completed, and it is a bit of a shame that we do
	  not, but that is how seriously we take privacy.
	  <br><br> 
	  Like nearly all websites, Game Maven has web server logs that
	  may contain the IP address used to access the web server.  That
	  is standard in nearly all webservers and not an attempt at data
	  collection.
	  <br><br>
	  In keeping with standard language in privacy policies,
	  personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to a
	  third party unless required by law and we may update this policy
	  from time to time at our sole discretion.
	  <br><br>
	  We are very protective of your privacy.  We like it that way.

	  <h3>Old Browser Warning</h3>
	  Oh my.  Game Maven does not like your web browser.  Your browser
	  is really old.  You need a new web browser.
	  <br><br> 
	  Game Maven likes <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>
	  and <a href="http://mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a>.  You can
	  play with Game Maven if you have those.  Go get them and let's play!
	  <br><br>
	  If you want to try to use Game Maven anyway, go ahead and try, but
	  Game Maven probably will not come out to play.  Your web browser
	  isn't good.  She does not like it at all.
