#### Game Maven from Crunchzilla

Game Maven from Crunchzilla is live Javascript programming for
fun.  It's an interactive tutorial with a focus on action over explanation.

When you work through Game Maven, you dive right into coding, and the
code you write immediately yields visible results.

Game Maven from Crunchzilla is publicly available to play for free
at

http://www.crunchzilla.com/

Game Maven from Crunchzilla  is the most advanced programming
tutorial in Crunchzilla series. Game Maven teaches some of the
basics of programming casual video games and is intended for
teens or adults who either have already done most of Code Maven or 
already have some programming experience.

We decided to make a version of code for the tutorial itself available for
others to modify, use, and translate.

If you want to create your own lessons or translate the existing
lessons to a language other than English, the lesson content is
entirely contained in gamemaven-lessons.js in a large JSON
file. Changing just that file will allow you to create your own lesson
content. If you want to change or translate the help menus or title,
edit the index.html file.

To deploy your modified code to your own webserver, just upload all
the files to your favorite host. The code only contacts the server
once at initialization to download all the lessons (intentionally,
allowing people to play offline if they want to). You don't need any
special configuration; just upload all the files like this was a web
page.

If you build anything using the code for Game Maven from
Crunchzilla, it'd be nice to credit Crunchzilla.com for the original
code, though you don't have to.  If you want to show off anything you
build using this code, we'd love to hear from you
(contact@crunchzilla.com).
